# Framework 
PiTest :- PIT is a state of the art mutation testing system, providing gold standard test coverage for Java and the jvm. It's fast, scalable and integrates with modern test and build tooling.
JUnit5 :- JUnit 5 is the current generation of the JUnit testing framework, which provides a modern foundation for developer-side testing on the JVM. This includes focusing on Java 8 and above, as well as enabling many different styles of testing.

## What is mutation testing ?
Faults (or mutations) are automatically seeded into your code, then your tests are run. If your tests fail then the mutation is killed, if your tests pass then the mutation lived.
The quality of your tests can be gauged from the percentage of mutations killed.
